### **Overview of the Flow**
1. **Frontend Responsibilities (Next.js)**:
    - Handle the Google OAuth flow.
    - Manage user sessions (e.g., generate and validate session tokens).
    - Send user data to the backend for registration if the user is signing in for the first time.

2. **Backend Responsibilities (Spring Boot)**:
    - Store and manage user data in a database.
    - Validate tokens received from the frontend for every API request.
    - Perform backend logic, like accessing or modifying data based on user permissions.

### **Detailed Flow**

1. **Login/Sign-In Flow**:
    - **Frontend**:
        - Use a library like `next-auth` or directly integrate Google OAuth to allow users to log in.
        - After successful login, receive user details from Google (e.g., email, name, profile picture).
        - Send the user details to the backend to register the user if they don't already exist in your system.

    - **Backend**:
        - Create or update the user record in the database using the provided details.
        - Respond to the frontend with a confirmation (e.g., HTTP 200 or 201).

2. **Session Creation**:
    - **Frontend**:
        - Create a session token (JWT or similar) after successfully registering/logging in the user.
        - Store the token securely (e.g., HTTP-only cookies or local storage, though cookies are recommended for security).
        - Use the token for authenticating future requests to the backend.

3. **Authenticated Requests**:
    - **Frontend**:
        - Include the session token in the Authorization header or as part of the request payload when making API calls to the backend.
    - **Backend**:
        - Validate the token in a filter or middleware (e.g., with a library like `jjwt` for JWT in Java).
        - Decode the token to extract user information (e.g., user ID).
        - Proceed with the requested action if the token is valid; otherwise, return an unauthorized response (e.g., HTTP 401).

4. **Session Management**:
    - **Frontend**:
        - Ensure tokens expire after a certain time for security.
        - Implement a refresh mechanism if you decide to use short-lived tokens.
    - **Backend**:
        - Optionally, maintain a blacklist or invalidate tokens for logout scenarios.

### **How to Start**

1. **Frontend Setup**:
    - Initialize a Next.js project.
    - Install and configure `next-auth` or another OAuth library.
    - Set up pages for login and registration.

2. **Backend Setup**:
    - Create a Spring Boot project.
    - Add dependencies for Spring Security and JWT.
    - Set up database schema and repository for user data.

3. **Integration**:
    - Test the OAuth flow on the frontend to retrieve user details.
    - Create an API endpoint in Spring Boot to receive and store user details.
    - Implement token validation in the backend for secured endpoints.

4. **Testing**:
    - Test the login/sign-in flow end-to-end.
    - Verify session token validation.
    - Securely handle edge cases like token expiration or invalid tokens.
